### About
A program in C#.NET with a command line interface which calls a procedure that requires four parameters. The program allows for the following configuration scenarios:

1.	Uses four command line arguments; or 
2.	Prompts the user to input the four command line arguments if they are not configured or the user selects to do so.
The four required parameters are:

1.	DictionaryFile – a path for a text file containing the four letter words.
2.	StartWord – a four letter word.
3.	EndWord – a four letter word.
4.	ResultFile – a path to a text file that will contain the result.

The problem is that given a starting word and an end word, can the starting word be transformed into the end word by swapping one character at a time where each intermediate word is present in the dictionary file.
